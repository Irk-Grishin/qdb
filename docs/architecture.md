# QDB Architecture Overview

QDB consists of several core components:

- **Query Layer (STQL)**: SQL-like language with support for spatial and temporal filters.
- **Warp Cachingâ„¢**: accelerates access using in-memory (Redis-like) and warm (Aero-like) layers.
- **QDLP Engine**: locates atomic/molecular signatures across the universe.
- **Read-Only Model**: reading is omnipresent; writing to reality is not supported (yet).

Together, these form a resilient, scalable, and whimsical infrastructure.
